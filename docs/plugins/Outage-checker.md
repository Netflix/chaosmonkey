An outage checker is used to automatically disable Chaos Monkey during ongoing outages.

If you wish to have Chaos Monkey check if there is an ongoing outage and disable
accordingly, you need to:

1. Give your outage checker a name (e.g., "chatbot")
1. Code up a type in Go that implements the [Outage](https://godoc.org/github.com/netflix/chaosmonkey/#Outage) interface.
1. Modify [outage.go](https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey/blob/master/outage/outage.go) so that it recognizes your outage checker.
1. Edit your [config file](Configuration File Format) to specify your outage checker.
