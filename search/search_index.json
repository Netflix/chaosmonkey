You need to be running Deck version\nv.2839.0 or greater for Chaos Monkey support. Check which version of Deck you are\nrunning by hitting the \n/version.json\n endpoint of your Spinnaker deployment.\n(Note that this version information will not be present if you are running\nDeck using a \nDocker container hosted on Quay\n).\n\n\nDeck has a config file named \n/var/www/settings.js\n. In this file there is a\n\"feature\" object that contains a number of feature flags:\n\n\n  feature: {\n    pipelines: true,\n    notifications: false,\n    fastProperty: true,\n    ...\n\n\n\n\nAdd the following flag:\n\n\nchaosMonkey: true\n\n\n\n\nIf the feature was enabled successfully, when you create a new app with Spinnaker, you will see\na \"Chaos Monkey: Enabled\" checkbox in the \"New Application\" modal dialog. If it\ndoes not appear, you may need to deploy a more recent version of Spinnaker.\n\n\n\n\nFor more details, see \nAdditional configuration files\n on the\nSpinnaker website.\n\n\nCreate the MySQL database\n\n\nChaos Monkey uses a MySQL database as a backend to record a daily termination\nschedule and to enforce a minimum time between terminations. (By default, Chaos\nMonkey will not terminate more than one instance per day per group).\n\n\nLog in to your MySQL deployment and create a database named \nchaosmonkey\n:\n\n\nmysql\n CREATE DATABASE chaosmonkey;\n\n\n\n\nNote: Chaos Monkey does not currently include a mechanism for purging old data.\nUntil this function exists, it is the operator's responsibility to remove old\ndata as needed.\n\n\nWrite a configuration file (chaosmonkey.toml)\n\n\nSee \nConfiguration file format\n for the configuration file format.\n\n\nCreate the database schema\n\n\nOnce you have created a \nchaosmonkey\n database and have populated the\nconfiguration file with the database credentials, add the tables to the database\nby doing:\n\n\nchaosmonkey migrate\n\n\n\n\nVerifying Chaos Monkey is configured properly\n\n\nChaos Monkey supports a number of command-line arguments that are useful for\nverifying that things are working properly.\n\n\nSpinnaker\n\n\nYou can verify that Chaos Monkey reach Spinnaker by fetching the Chaos Monkey\nconfiguration for an app:\n\n\nchaosmonkey config \nappname\n\n\n\n\n\nIf successful, you'll see output that looks like:\n\n\n(*chaosmonkey.AppConfig)(0xc4202ec0c0)({\n Enabled: (bool) true,\n RegionsAreIndependent: (bool) true,\n MeanTimeBetweenKillsInWorkDays: (int) 2,\n MinTimeBetweenKillsInWorkDays: (int) 1,\n Grouping: (chaosmonkey.Group) cluster,\n Exceptions: ([]chaosmonkey.Exception) {\n }\n})\n\n\n\n\nIf it fails, you'll see an error message.\n\n\nDatabase\n\n\nYou can verify that Chaos Monkey can reach the database by attempting to\nretrieve the termination schedule for the day.\n\n\nchaosmonkey fetch-schedule\n\n\n\n\nIf successful, you should see output like:\n\n\n[69400] 2016/09/30 23:41:03 chaosmonkey fetch-schedule starting\n[69400] 2016/09/30 23:41:03 Writing /etc/cron.d/chaosmonkey-daily-terminations\n[69400] 2016/09/30 23:41:03 chaosmonkey fetch-schedule done\n\n\n\n\n(Chaos Monkey will write an empty file to\n\n/etc/cron.d/chaosmonkey-daily-terminations\n since the database does not contain\nany termination schedules yet).\n\n\nIf Chaos Monkey cannot reach the database, you will see an error. For example:\n\n\n[69668] 2016/09/30 23:43:50 chaosmonkey fetch-schedule starting\n[69668] 2016/09/30 23:43:50 FATAL: could not fetch schedule: failed to retrieve schedule for 2016-09-30 23:43:50.953795019 -0700 PDT: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:3306: getsockopt: connection refused\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a termination schedule\n\n\nYou can manually invoke Chaos Monkey to generate a schedule file. When testing,\nyou may want to specify \n--no-record-schedule\n so the schedule doesn't get\nwritten to the database.\n\n\nIf you have many apps and you don't want to sit there while Chaos Monkey\ngenerates a complete schedule, you can limit the number of apps  using the\n\n--max-apps=\nnumber\n. For example:\n\n\nchaosmonkey schedule --no-record-schedule --max-apps=10\n\n\n\n\nTerminate an instance\n\n\nYou can manually invoke Chaos Monkey to terminate an instance. For example:\n\n\nchaosmonkey terminate chaosguineapig test --cluster=chaosguineapig --region=us-east-1\n\n\n\n\nOptional: Dynamic properties (etcd, consul)\n\n\nChaos Monkey supports changing the following configuration properties dynamically:\n\n\n\n\nchaosmonkey.enabled\n\n\nchaosmonkey.leashed\n\n\nchaosmonkey.schedule_enabled\n\n\nchaosmonkey.accounts\n\n\n\n\nThese are intended to allow an operator to make certain changes to Chaos\nMonkey's behavior without having to redeploy.\n\n\nNote: the configuration file takes precedence over dynamic provider, so do\nnot specify these properties in the config file if you want to set them\ndynamically.\n\n\nTo take advantage of dynamic properties, you need to keep those properties in\neither \netcd\n or \nConsul\n and add a \n[dynamic]\n section that contains the\nendpoint for the service and a path that returns a JSON file that has each of\nthe properties you want to set dynamically.\n\n\nChaos Monkey uses the \nViper\n library to implement dynamic configuration, see the\nViper \nremote key/value store support\n docs for more details.\n\n\nSet up a cron job that runs Chaos Monkey daily schedule\n\n\nCreate /apps/chaosmonkey/chaosmonkey-schedule.sh\n\n\nFor the remainder if the docs, we assume you have copied the chaosmonkey binary\nto \n/apps/chaosmonkey\n, and will create the scripts described below there as\nwell. However, Chaos Monkey makes no explicit assumptions about the location of\nthese files.\n\n\nCreate a file called \nchaosmonkey-schedule.sh\n that invokes \nchaosmonkey\nschedule\n and writes the output to a logfile.\n\n\nNote that because this will be invoked from cron, the PATH will likely not include the\nlocation of the chaosmonkey binary so be sure to specify it explicitly.\n\n\n/apps/chaosmonkey/chaosmonkey-schedule.sh:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n/apps/chaosmonkey/chaosmonkey schedule \n /var/log/chaosmonkey-schedule.log 2\n1\n\n\n\n\nCreate /etc/cron.d/chaosmonkey-schedule\n\n\nOnce you have this script, create a cron job that invokes it once a day. Chaos\nMonkey starts terminating at \nchaosmonkey.start_hour\n in\n\nchaosmonkey.time_zone\n, so it's best to pick a time earlier in the day.\n\n\nThe example below generates termination schedules each weekday at 12:00 system\ntime (which we assume is in UTC).\n\n\n/etc/cron.d/chaosmonkey-schedule:\n\n\n# Run the Chaos Monkey scheduler at 5AM PDT (4AM PST) every weekday\n# This corresponds to: 12:00 UTC\n# Because system clock runs UTC, time change affects when job runs\n\n# The scheduler must run as root because it needs root permissions to write\n# to the file /etc/cron.d/chaosmonkey-daily-terminations\n\n# min  hour  dom  month  day  user  command\n    0    12    *      *  1-5  root  /apps/chaosmonkey/chaosmonkey-schedule.sh\n\n\n\n\nCreate /apps/chaosmonkey/chaosmonkey-terminate.sh\n\n\nWhen Chaos Monkey schedules terminations, it will create cron jobs that call the\npath specified by \nchaosmonkey.term_path\n, which defaults to /apps/chaosmonkey/chaosmonkey-terminate.sh\n\n\n/apps/chaosmonkey/chaosmonkey-terminate.sh:\n\n\n#!/bin/bash\n/apps/chaosmonkey/chaosmonkey terminate \n$@\n \n /var/log/chaosmonkey-terminate.log 2\n1",
